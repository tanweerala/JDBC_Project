Loading driver class and createting connection object
=====================================================
Every database vendors provide this class(name of the class will be different)
Every driver class is implementation of java.sql.Driver interface
Every driver class has several methods.One of them is as follows

public Connection connect(String url,Properties p);

This method is declared inside Driver interface
Implementation of this method is given inside driver classes
This method is responsible to perform following two tasks
1)Connection with database server
2)Creating and returning object of java.sql.Connection interface.This object is called connection object

connect() method of driver(class) must be called(either directly or indireclty) by our program to make connection with database server and create connection object

Remember code to call connect() method has already been written inside java.sql.DriverManager class. getConnection() method of DriverManager class contains this code
We will have to write code to call getConnection() method
getConnection() method is as follows

public static Connection getConnection(String url,String username,String password);

Remember DriverManager class must of reference of driver class object. Becuase getConnection() method of DriverManager class is going to call connect() method of driver class

Note:Every driver class on loading creates and object of itself and registers this object(gives this object) to the DriverManager class.

Class.forName("fully-squalified-driver-class-name");


Don't forget to add jar file of database vendors code into your project

Class.forName("com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver");
Connection cn=DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/jdbc2","root","mysql");
